(EHR-MC-001001-20260218-01)\n\n### 3. Analysis of Patient Risk Notification Regarding Potential Liver Injury\n\n*   **Risk Level:** High\n*   **Reasoning:** The patient is at high risk for undiagnosed or progressing liver injury due to a critical and sustained absence of liver function test (LFT) monitoring after February 2025, precisely when exposed to multiple highly hepatotoxic agents. Key exposures include Methotrexate (15mg weekly, re-introduced despite prior GI intolerance and inconsistent Folic Acid intake) and potential turmeric supplements (reported in October 2024), both known causes of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The patient's debilitating fatigue has been worsening and intensifying from late 2024 into 2026, temporally aligning with these exposures and the lack of monitoring, suggesting potential undetected liver dysfunction. Furthermore, significant metabolic risk factors such as Class I obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus predispose the patient to Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)/Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which increases susceptibility to DILI. The absence of viral serologies and autoimmune markers leaves alternative liver conditions unexcluded.\n*   **Evidence:**\n    *   Critical and sustained data gap in liver function test (LFT) monitoring after February 2025, despite introduction of high-risk medications.\n    *   Re-introduction of Methotrexate (MTX) 15mg weekly around September 2025, despite prior gastrointestinal intolerance to the drug and inconsistent Folic Acid intake.\n    *   Patient reported using turmeric supplements in October 2024, an agent with emerging high hepatotoxic potential.\n    *   Debilitating chronic fatigue, described as worsening and intensifying from late 2024/early 2025 into 2026, temporally aligns with high-risk drug exposures and cessation of LFT monitoring.\n    *   Patient has significant metabolic risk factors for NAFLD/MASLD including Class I obesity (BMI 27-29.8 kg/m²), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (February 2026).\n    *   Specific serologies for Hepatitis A, B, and C and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, LKM-1) were not provided, leaving alternative diagnoses unexcluded.\n*   **Probability:** 80%\n\n### 4. Concise Explanation of the Risk Notification for Discussion with Healthcare Providers\n\n*   **Summary:** Sarah Miller is at high risk for liver injury due to potential DILI or underlying NAFLD/MASLD.\n*   **Key Concerns:**\n    *   **Lack of LFT Monitoring:** No documented LFTs after February 2025, despite ongoing use of potentially hepatotoxic medications.\n    *   **Methotrexate Use:** MTX is hepatotoxic, and its use in the setting of possible non-adherence to folic acid increases risk. MTX was restarted despite potential prior intolerance.\n    *   **Turmeric Supplement:** Potential hepatotoxicity.\n    *   **Worsening Fatigue:** Could be a sign of liver dysfunction.\n    *   **Metabolic Risk Factors:** Obesity, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and T2DM increase risk of NAFLD/MASLD, predisposing to DILI.\n*   **Missing Information:** Hepatitis A, B, C serologies and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, LKM-1)\n\n### 5. Documentation of Review Process and Key Discussion Points\n\n*   **Review Process:** Comprehensive review of EHR data from 2015-08-10 to 2026-07-10.\n*   **Key Discussion Points:**\n    *   The need for immediate LFTs.\n    *   The potential need for discontinuation or dose adjustment of MTX if LFTs are elevated.\n    *   The importance of adherence to folic acid supplementation with MTX.\n    *   The need to investigate the use of turmeric supplements further.\n    *   The importance of ruling out other causes of liver disease (viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis).\n    *   The need to address metabolic risk factors (weight loss, blood pressure control, lipid management, diabetes management).\n    *   The significance of patient's report of worsening fatigue.\n\n### Next Actions\n\n*   **Urgent:** Order comprehensive LFT panel (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Total/Direct Bilirubin, Albumin, INR, Platelet Count) (**Urgent**)\n    *Rationale:* To assess current liver function due to risk factors and lack of recent monitoring.\n*   **Soon:** Check Hepatitis A, B, C serologies, ANA, ASMA, LKM-1.

(EHR-MC-001001-20260218-01)\n\n### 3. Analysis of Patient Risk Notification Regarding Potential Liver Injury\n\n*   **Risk Level:** High\n*   **Reasoning:** The patient is at high risk for undiagnosed or progressing liver injury due to a critical and sustained absence of liver function test (LFT) monitoring after February 2025, precisely when exposed to multiple highly hepatotoxic agents. Key exposures include Methotrexate (15mg weekly, re-introduced despite prior GI intolerance and inconsistent Folic Acid intake) and potential turmeric supplements (reported in October 2024), both known causes of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The patient's debilitating fatigue has been worsening and intensifying from late 2024 into 2026, temporally aligning with these exposures and the lack of monitoring, suggesting potential undetected liver dysfunction. Furthermore, significant metabolic risk factors such as Class I obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus predispose the patient to Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)/Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which increases susceptibility to DILI. The absence of viral serologies and autoimmune markers leaves alternative liver conditions unexcluded.\n*   **Evidence:**\n    *   Critical and sustained data gap in liver function test (LFT) monitoring after February 2025, despite introduction of high-risk medications.\n    *   Re-introduction of Methotrexate (MTX) 15mg weekly around September 2025, despite prior gastrointestinal intolerance to the drug and inconsistent Folic Acid intake.\n    *   Patient reported using turmeric supplements in October 2024, an agent with emerging high hepatotoxic potential.\n    *   Debilitating chronic fatigue, described as worsening and intensifying from late 2024/early 2025 into 2026, temporally aligns with high-risk drug exposures and cessation of LFT monitoring.\n    *   Patient has significant metabolic risk factors for NAFLD/MASLD including Class I obesity (BMI 27-29.8 kg/m²), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (February 2026).\n    *   Specific serologies for Hepatitis A, B, and C and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, LKM-1) were not provided, leaving alternative diagnoses unexcluded.\n*   **Probability:** 80%\n\n### 4. Concise Explanation of the Risk Notification for Discussion with Healthcare Providers\n\n*   **Summary:** Sarah Miller is at high risk for liver injury due to potential DILI or underlying NAFLD/MASLD.\n*   **Key Concerns:**\n    *   **Lack of LFT Monitoring:** No documented LFTs after February 2025, despite ongoing use of potentially hepatotoxic medications.\n    *   **Methotrexate Use:** MTX is hepatotoxic, and its use in the setting of possible non-adherence to folic acid increases risk. MTX was restarted despite potential prior intolerance.\n    *   **Turmeric Supplement:** Potential hepatotoxicity.\n    *   **Worsening Fatigue:** Could be a sign of liver dysfunction.\n    *   **Metabolic Risk Factors:** Obesity, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and T2DM increase risk of NAFLD/MASLD, predisposing to DILI.\n*   **Missing Information:** Hepatitis A, B, C serologies and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, LKM-1)\n\n### 5. Documentation of Review Process and Key Discussion Points\n\n*   **Review Process:** Comprehensive review of EHR data from 2015-08-10 to 2026-07-10.\n*   **Key Discussion Points:**\n    *   The need for immediate LFTs.\n    *   The potential need for discontinuation or dose adjustment of MTX if LFTs are elevated.\n    *   The importance of adherence to folic acid supplementation with MTX.\n    *   The need to investigate the use of turmeric supplements further.\n    *   The importance of ruling out other causes of liver disease (viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis).\n    *   The need to address metabolic risk factors (weight loss, blood pressure control, lipid management, diabetes management).\n    *   The significance of patient's report of worsening fatigue.\n\n### Next Actions\n\n*   **Urgent:** Order comprehensive LFT panel (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Total/Direct Bilirubin, Albumin, INR, Platelet Count) (**Urgent**)\n    *Rationale:* To assess current liver function due to risk factors and lack of recent monitoring.\n*   **Soon:** Check Hepatitis A, B, C serologies, ANA, ASMA, LKM-1. (**Soon**)\n    *Rationale:* Rule out other causes of liver disease.\n*   **Soon:** Medication Review and Reconciliation (**Soon**)\n    *Rationale:* Clarify MTX dose and route, folic acid adherence, and concurrent medications.\n*   **Soon:** Refer to Hepatology (**Soon**)\n    *Rationale:* For further evaluation and management of potential liver injury, including possible liver biopsy. Include all EHR data, including medication list, lab results, and imaging reports. Specifically highlight the lack of LFT monitoring, MTX use, potential turmeric use, and metabolic risk factors.\n"
